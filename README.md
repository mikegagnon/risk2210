Risk2210
========

Simulates battles for Risk 2210 AD via Scala repl.

I work at Twitter on the *Revenue Risk* team. To celebrate our work we decided to play
a game of Risk 2210 AD. But it would set a bad example for us to play such a risky
game without having a mechanism to calculate our risks.

Hence this simulator.

Now we can play *Calculated Risk 2210 A.D.*
